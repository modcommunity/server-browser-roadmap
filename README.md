### üöÄ Our Public Roadmap

* Check out our [**Milestones**](https://github.com/modcommunity/roadmap/milestones)!  
  * Each milestone begins with a **module** name, which represents a specific part of the website (e.g. `servers`, `mods`, `community`).  
  * We‚Äôre currently using a simple versioning format:  
    ```
    <module>-v<major>.0
    ```
  * Every `<major>` version marks a significant release or feature addition (e.g. `mods-v2.0`).  
* Each **module** also has a corresponding [**label**](https://github.com/modcommunity/roadmap/labels), making it easy to filter and sort related issues.

‚ö†Ô∏è This system is subject to change over time as development progresses!
